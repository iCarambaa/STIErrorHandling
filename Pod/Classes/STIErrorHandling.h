 The configurators which will be called before the error is forwarded to the responder chain.
 
 The `configurators` are a easy way to process errors before handing control over to the responder chain.
 They can be used to ensure that lower level API Errors are always wrapped into meaningful errors or to
 ensure no "user cancelled" errors are bubbled up the chain.
 
 New configurators can be added by calling `-[STIErrorHandling addErrorConfiguratorBeforeChain:]`.
